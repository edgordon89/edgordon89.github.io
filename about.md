Product Manager based in Leeds, currently working for the UK Civil Service.

In the past, I've worked for [Sky](https://www.sky.com/shop/broadband-talk/) and a publishing company called [Packt](https://subscribe.packtpub.com/). At both, I've been responsible for various customer acquisition journeys in to their subscription products. You may remember me from such highlights as: Sky Broadband, GDPR consent, Packt Subscription, and many more.

Further back than that, I was a Commissioning Editor and [commissioned and published](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?query=Edward%20Gordon%20Packt&extended_publisher_data=true&highlight=true&include_assessments=false&include_case_studies=true&include_courses=true&include_orioles=true&include_playlists=true&include_collections=true&include_notebooks=true&is_academic_institution_account=false&source=user&publishers=Packt%20Publishing&sort=publication_date&facet_json=true&page=0) some of Packt's most successful books in their Web Development category.

In my current role, I work on helping the Civil Service create better experiences for people claiming benefit.
