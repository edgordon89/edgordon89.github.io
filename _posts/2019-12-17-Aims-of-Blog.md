## Aims of the blog
 + To provide some tips on how to be a Product Manager, based on my experience. I've only been in the job since 2016, maybe hearing from a noob is more appealing to you than someone more qualified.
 + To re-enforce the idea that Product Management, based on my experience, is absolutely nothing like you learn on training or read in books.
 + To help myself interpret what I know by writing it out.
 + To put as a link on my CV... Hello future employer, you are my only reader...

## Why you should care
I am an accidental Product Manager. I left university wanting to be an editor (had to put my English degree to good use). I spent nearly 4 years commissioning and editing books about software. And then through a series of fairly innocuous steps, I ended up as a Product Manager.
I then took a job at Sky, as a Product Owner - something which I had never done before, and which had absolutely no training or onboarding.
And last year I moved to the Civil Service as a Product Owner (now Product Manager, after a job title change...). They also have no training or onboarding, at all.

So I've learned on the job, through piecing together info from books, blog posts, trial, error, and the odd training course thrown in. I'll write out some of the things I've learned. And let it be a record for all of time (until Github Pages decides to start charging).
