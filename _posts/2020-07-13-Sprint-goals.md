title: Don't Confuse Sprint Goals with Product Goals
---
>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. Sprint goals are the result of a negotiation between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Sprint Goals should be specific and measurable.

This is how scrum.org describes a Sprint Goal. It's neat, and teams generally seem to expect there to be a 'goal' that's magically presented by the Product Manager in Sprint Planning. But if I ask myself how many times I've successfully seen a Sprint Goal be delivered in a Sprint, the answer is 'far less than the number of Sprints I've been a Product Manager for'. So something's going wrong.

I think this is because "goals" are agnostic of time, and Sprints are not. A goal is ready when it's ready, and done when it's done. A Sprint is finished every 2nd Wednesday. The two can sometimes be aligned, but often this is coincidental rather than by design. I've found that what normally happens is that goals conveniently shrink over time to fit in to a 2 week cadence. This just doesn't work, and sets teams up for failure as well as compromising the view of the goals you want to achieve with your Product.

I propose a change to how Sprint Goals are used within the team. Simply, have two really visible goals at any time in your team: Sprint Goals and Product Goals.

 - *Sprint goals* agree low-level changes and ways of working the team wants to commit to in a fixed-time window.
 - *Product goals* give clarity on what the product is trying to achieve, in priority order.

Use 'Sprint Goals' to agree _internal_ measures of success that are not tied to Product outcomes. Things that may be tied to team improvements or processes are normally pretty good:
 - Don't let QA have more than 3 tickets
 - Document more decisions in Confluence
 - Run an amigos for each ticket

They work great, because they're tangible and achievable within the team. You don't need to be limited to these. But it's a way of saying, 'how do we want to work over the coming 2 weeks that will help us improve?'

Use Product Goals to agree _external_ outcomes that you want to achieve. Things such as:
 - Finish the feature
 - Add new functionality
 - Whatever else you can think of

This should essentially be your roadmap, and the things you're working on should tie up to those outcomes. To achieve these goals, it may take one or more Sprints, but it's still the goal. When you think you've done enough to move on to the next thing, then you can look at your next roadmap item and that can become your goal. If the priority changes, change the Product Goal you're working towards.

In reality, this means making sure that your Sprit Planning sessions include an overview of the progress towards Product Goals, and high-level updates about changes to priority. You can use this to set the context of the work you should be bringing in to Sprint to take you closer to your goals, but allows you the freedom to not tie the success and failure of your Sprints to whether or not you've 'done' things that may take longer than your Sprint to reasonably do.

Trying to make your Sprint Goal == specific Product outcomes is an exercise in futility. Instead, have both - the Sprint Goal should be agreed by the team about how they want to work. The Product Goals should be driven by the roadmap and may span multiple Sprints.
