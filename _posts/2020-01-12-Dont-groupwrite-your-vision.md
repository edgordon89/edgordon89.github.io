title: Don't group-write your product vision
---
We've all been there. 15 people in a room, staring down the horror of trying to co-author a vision for a product. <!--more-->The abject pain of the person with the pen (often you) trying to coax coherence from the jaws of absurdity. Then when you think you're getting somewhere, from the back of the room someone shouts up - "Won't someone think of the badgers?!" - and you're back to square one. You've got a product vision that is about as robust as a damp flannel.

Fundamentally this is because most people in the room misunderstand what a vision is for. A vision is a shared intent, not a fixed sentence. The words mean less than the understanding. Your goal is come up with a vision that helps set the context of the rest of the work, not to balance the semantic value of 'fast' vs 'efficient'.

Luckily there is a solution to this. And it's not that you - as a Product Manager - should just write the vision.

## BYO vision
When we recently ran a workshop to thrash out our product vision, we did it in 20 minutes. And it's as serviceable as one that took all day. Here's how we did it:

  1. We only invited people who knew about the problem area already.
  2. Everyone in the room got one post-it.
  3. On that post-it, they wrote what they thought the vision for the product should be. This took 5 minutes.
  4. Everyone put their post-its on the wall without comment.
  5. Everyone read everyone else's post-its, and got one vote to vote for their favourite. People can vote for their own.
  6. The post-it with the most votes was our vision.

The advantages of this far outweigh the disadvantages. By removing any group shout-it-out sessions, you are able to come up with 7 - 15 coherent and workable visions in a short timeframe. By not presenting them to the group, you are avoiding bias to whatever you, or a senior colleague, presents. By allowing simple dot-voting you are getting the group to generate their own buy-in to what the product's trying to achieve; I don't have to try and sell anything to them.

## Things to bear in mind
There are obviously caveats to this. No 1. is probably the most important step. In our workshop, there was no one in there that I wouldn't trust to create a good vision for the product. They all had the relevant background in the area to be able to think about what we were trying to do with the product, and we'd done a lot of work already setting the business problems up with the team. If you're inviting people who don't know the problem area to the session, you're going to get bad input even from good people.

You also want to encourage self-editing, and only allow each person one attempt. There is such thing as a bad idea, and I've noticed improvements in overall quality when people have to try and self-select, rather than spam out as many that come to mind as they think.

If you end up with everyone voting for their own vision, then you need someone designated as the decider. This could be you as Product Manager, or whoever you want really.

There is also the danger that you completely hate whatever the winner is. This has never happened to me personally, but I have seen it happen. Everyone agreed something in the meeting, then a week later the senior manager decided they hated it, and wrote their own. This was disheartening to the team, and could have been avoided if discussed in the session. Generally, if you like your own ideas better than anyone else's, this way of creating a vision isn't for you. And I wonder if you're in the right job...

## What you'll end up with
The likelihood is that implementation won't be as easy as the 6 steps list above. We ended up with 2 different visions that shared most of the votes. It was obvious that there was something good in both, and I took them away and wrote the final version that covered off both intents. But we ended up with a shared understanding that carried us through the rest of the session, and will remain our vision for the next phase of the product.
