title: Product Cartography and the Industry of Mapping
---
Product, as a function, has a tendency to produce elaborate, visual, maps and diagrams that require a key to understand and link-throughs for 'further context'. Every time I see another one, I want to die.

You know the kind. They cover a whole wall of whiteboard for 6 months, or 50m of brown paper. Sometimes it's digital but it's always the same kind of mess. Arrows, codas, 30*30 grid of post-its.

In itself this may not be a problem, other than lost white-board space. The problems really start when people conceive of their document as an artefact, when in fact it's just a facilitation tool.

## The maps that have lost their way
These documents - roadmaps, service maps, story maps (any kind of 'map') - take a lot of time and energy to create. It can be tempting to see that time and energy wasted if the document isn't converted in to an artefact. So people do it, and they make an industry out of doing it. We no longer have Product Owners or Service Designers. We have cartographers, and they have a job to do: things have to be added to the map; the map must be updated; the map must be visible as an information radiator; the map must be consulted. People spend more time maintaining the map than others do reading it. The information radiator becomes endothermic.

Suddenly, it's no longer a map. It has become an idol; a fat golden calf that demands its worship. And what does it give you for all this worship?

To anyone that wasn't part of 'the map's' production, they can often be simultaneously lacking in detail and overflowing with it. You need to know the system already to recognise the map. They are difficult to follow; quickly out of date; difficult to change quickly; and a poor visual aide even when you're being walked through it by the map's owner.

## So why use maps?
I still use maps to perform important functions in my product delivery toolbox. But I'm trying to treat them as a one-off. Maps are your team's meeting notes from a great session. They help capture the moment of conversation, and trigger the creation of other more appropriate artefacts to capture details and follow ups. User stories in Jira, process flow diagrams, Power-Point roadmaps, even Word documents add up to give you more tools to explain the same concepts as your map in a more appropriate manner. They are more accessible, more maintainable, and more flexible than a map the size of your team's wall space. They don't look as fancy but they do more heavy lifting.

Maps work best when used as a prompt in a meeting, and a historical document for occasional reference. When people try to make them the centre of the product development process, the panacea of product artefacts they are at their absolute worst. They will become the ongoing 'agile' albatross slung around your neck. Use with caution.
