title: Decoding the Tactical - The Language of Big Business
---
If you work within a big business for long enough, you soon hear the distinction between 'tactical' and 'strategic'. Tactical is the war-room fix, the 'get-it-over-the-line', the 'we-know-it's-not-great-but...' type of solution. Strategic is the inverse: 'ideal-world', 'obviously-we-should-do-it-like-this-but...'.

The simplest way of decoding this talk is to replace 'tactical' with 'shit'. And 'strategic' with 'expensive'. Businesses say they don't want either, but in reality they are happier with shit than expensive every time.

## So how are we meant to handle it?

One of the things I've tried to do recently is to stop talking about tactical vs strategic. It implies that the business has tactics and strategies, and it invariably doesn't. It only has projects and stakeholders. Not talking about the choice of tactical vs strategic has allowed me to (almost) stop talking about features. And honestly, talking about features with stakeholders is like talking to my dog about not eating fire -  think they know best, and never, ever, learn from past endeavours.

Luckily, the goals of both the tactical and strategic solution are invariably the same, but the method of implementation - the features - are different. When you can get your stakeholders to start to talk about outcomes, it becomes easier to create your own roadmaps that can achieve those outcomes. And the choice between tactical/strategic is a priority choice you make within your own backlogs. The decision about 'how' sits back within the team, rather than with the program steer board (I know you have one, everyone does).

And it starts by no longer talking about tactical vs strategic.

## Glossary of nonsense
Here are a few terms you'll hear a lot, and what they really mean. I'll add to it in the future...

* Tactical = shit
* Strategic = won't happen
* MVP = something that gets shoved out, and never worked on again
* Agile = do loads more, much faster, with more constraints than waterfall...
* Waterfall = we've been told it's bad, but really it's how everything works
* Stakeholders = masses of uninformed opinions
* Legacy = the old thing that works well enough for no one to really want to move off it
